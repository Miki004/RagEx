Classical antiquity represented one of the most significant phases in human history, marked by the rise of the great Greek and Roman civilizations. The Greek civilization, which flourished between the 9th and 4th centuries BCE, gave rise to extraordinary innovations in philosophy, politics, art, and science. Athens, with its direct democracy, was one of the first examples of popular government, while philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle laid the foundations of Western thought.

Later, the Roman Empire consolidated and expanded upon these achievements, extending its influence over much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Traditionally founded in 27 BCE with Octavian Augustus, the Empire was notable for its military organization, infrastructure such as roads and aqueducts, and Roman law, which has profoundly influenced modern legal systems.

During the Middle Ages, a period spanning approximately from the 5th to the 15th century, Europe underwent profound transformations. The feudal system dominated the social and economic structure, while the Catholic Church played a central role in cultural and political life. The Crusades—religious wars for control of the Holy Land—marked this era, as did the rise of universities and the spread of scholastic thought.

The Renaissance, which began in Italy in the 14th century, marked a rebirth of the arts and sciences, with iconic figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Galileo Galilei. This period promoted humanism, which placed human beings and their capacity to reason and create at the center, and paved the way for the major geographic and scientific discoveries of the following centuries.

The modern era saw the formation of nation-states, the Protestant Reformation, and the Scientific Revolution, which radically changed the worldview. In the 18th century, the French Revolution affirmed the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, deeply influencing European and global politics.

The 19th and 20th centuries were characterized by rapid social, industrial, and political changes—from the world wars to struggles for civil rights and colonial independence. World War II was a crucial moment, marking the defeat of totalitarian regimes and the birth of new international organizations such as the United Nations, aimed at ensuring peace and cooperation among peoples.
